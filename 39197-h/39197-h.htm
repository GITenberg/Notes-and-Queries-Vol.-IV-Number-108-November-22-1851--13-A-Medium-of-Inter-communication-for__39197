<h3>
<span>AGE OF TREES.</span>
</h3>


<p>Alexander von Humboldt, in his work entitled <i>Views of Nature</i> (pp. 220.
268-276. ed. Bohn), has some interesting remarks on the age of trees.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"In vegetable forms (he says) <i>massive size</i> is indicative of
   age; and in the vegetable kingdom alone are age and the
   manifestation of an ever-renewed vigour linked together."</p>

<p>Following up this remark, he refers to specimens of the Baobab
(<i>Adansonia digitata</i>), with trunks measuring more than thirty feet in
diameter, the age of which is estimated by Adanson at 5150 years. All
calculations of the age of a tree, founded merely on the <i>size of its
trunk</i>, are, however, uncertain, unless the law of its growth, and the
limits of the variation producible by peculiar circumstances, are
ascertained, which, in the case of the Adansonia, have not been
determined. For the same reason, the calculation of 2,500 years for a
gigantic cypress in Persia, mentioned by Evelyn in his <i>Silva</i>, is of no
value.</p>

<p>Humboldt afterwards refers to "the more certain estimations yielded by
<i>annular rings</i>, and by the relation found to exist between the
thickness of the layer of wood and the duration of growth;" which, he
adds, give us shorter periods for our temperate northern zone. The
calculation of the age of a tree, founded on its successive rings,
appears to be quite certain; and whenever these can be counted, the age
of a tree can be determined without risk of error. Humboldt quotes a
statement from Endlicher, that "in Lithuania linden (or lime) trees have
been felled which measured 87 feet round, and in which 815 annular rings
have been counted." The section of a trunk of a silver fir, which grew
near Barr, is preserved in the Museum at Strasburg: its diameter was
eight feet close to the ground, and the number of rings is said to
amount to several hundreds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this mode of determining a tree's age cannot be applied to
a living tree; and it is only certain where the tree is sound at the
heart. Where a tree has become hollow from old age, the rings near the
centre, which constitute a part of the evidence of its duration, no
longer exist. Hence the age of the great oak of Saintes, in the
department of the Charente Inférieure, which measures twenty-three feet
in diameter five feet from the ground, and is large enough to contain a
small chamber, can only be estimated; and the antiquity of 1800 or 2000
years, which is assigned to it, must rest on an uncertain conjecture.</p>

<p>Decandolle lays it down that, of all European trees, the <i>yew</i> attains
the greatest age; and he assigns an antiquity of thirty centuries to the
<i>Taxus baccata</i> of Braburn in Kent; from twenty-five to thirty centuries
to the Scotch yew of Fortingal; and fourteen and a half and twelve
centuries respectively to those of Crowhurst in Surrey and Ripon
(Fountains Abbey) in Yorkshire. These<a id="Page_402"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[402]</span> ages are fixed by a
conjecture founded on the <i>size</i>, which can lead to no certain result.</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents state what is the greatest number of
rings which have been actually counted in any yew, or other tree, which
has grown in the British Isles, or elsewhere? It Is only by actual
enumeration that vegetable chronology can be satisfactorily determined:
but if the rings in many trees were counted, some relation between the
number of rings and the diameter of the trunk, for each species, might
probably be laid down within certain limits. These rings, being annually
deposited, form a natural chronicle of time, by which the age of a tree
is determined with as much precision as the lapse of human events is
determined by the cotemporaneous registration of annalists. Hence Milton
speaks of "monumental oak." Evelyn, who has devoted a long chapter of
his <i>Silva</i> to an investigation of the age of trees (b. iii. c. iii.),
founds his inferences chiefly on their <i>size</i>; but he cites the
following remark from Dr. Goddard:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It is commonly and very probably asserted, that a tree gains a
   new ring every year. In the body of a great oak in the New
   Forest, cut transversely even, (where many of the trees are
   accounted to be some hundreds of years old) three and four
   hundred have been distinguished."&mdash;Vol. ii. p. 202. ed. Hunter.</p>

<p>A delineation and description of the largest and most celebrated trees
of Great Britain may be seen in the interesting work of Jacob George
Strutt, entitled <i>Sylva Britannica, or Portraits of Forest Trees,
distinguished for their Antiquity, Magnitude, or Beauty</i>: London, 1822,
folio.</p>

<p>The age of some trees is determined by historical records, in the same
manner that we know the age of an ancient building, as the Parthenon,
the Colosseum, or the Tower of London. It is, however, important that
such historical evidence should be carefully scrutinised; for trees
which are known to be of great antiquity sometimes give rise to fabulous
legends, destitute of any foundation in fact. Such, for example, was the
plane-tree near Caphyæ, in Arcadia, seen by Pausanias in the second
century after Christ, which was reported by the inhabitants to have been
planted by Menelaus when he was collecting the army for the expedition
against Troy. (<i>Paus.</i> <span class="smaller">VIII.</span> 23.) Such too, doubtless, was the oak of
Mamre, where the angels were said to have appeared to Abraham.
(<i>Sozomen</i>, ii. 3.) A rose-tree growing in the crypt of the cathedral of
Hildesheim is referred, by a church-legend, to a date anterior to 1061;
which would imply an age of more than 800 years, but the evidence
adduced seems scarcely sufficient to identify the existing rose-tree
with the rose-tree of 1061. (See <i>Humboldt</i>, p. 275.)</p>

<p>In other cases, however, the historical evidence extant, if not
altogether free from doubt, is sufficient to carry the age of a tree
back to a remote date. The Swilcar Lawn oak, in Needwood Forest,
Staffordshire, is stated by Strutt, p. 2., "to be known by historical
documents to be at this time [1822] six hundred years old; and it is
still far from being in the last stage of decay." Of a great elm growing
at Chipstead Place in Kent, he says: "Its appearance altogether savours
enough of antiquity to bear out the tradition annexed to it, that in the
time of Henry V. a fair was held annually under its branches; the high
road from Rye in Sussex to London then passing close by it." (P. 5.) If
this tradition be authentic, the elm in question must have been a large
and wide-spreading tree in the years 1413-22. A yew-tree at Ankerwyke
House, near Staines, is supposed to be of great antiquity. There is a
tradition that Henry VIII. occasionally met Anne Boleyn under its
branches: but it is not stated how high this tradition ascends. (<i>Ib.</i>,
p. 8.) The Abbot's Oak, near Woburn Abbey, is stated to derive its name
from the fact that the abbot of the monastery was, by order of Henry
VIII., hung from its branches in 1537. (<i>Ib.</i>, p. 10.) But Query, is
this an authentic fact?</p>

<p>There is a tradition respecting the Shelton Oak near Shrewsbury, that
before the battle of Shrewsbury between Henry IV. and Hotspur, in 1403,
Owen Glendower reconnoitred the field from its branches, and afterwards
drew off his men. Positive documentary evidence, in the possession of
Richard Hill Waring, Esq., is likewise cited, which shows that this tree
was called "the Great Oak" in the year 1543 (<i>Ib.</i> p. 17.). There is a
traditional account that the old yew-trees at Fountains Abbey existed at
the foundation of the abbey, in the year 1132; but the authority for
this tradition, and the time at which it was first recorded, is not
stated. (P. 21.) The Abbot's Willow, near Bury St. Edmund's, stands on a
part of the ancient demesne of the Abbot of Bury, and is hence
conjectured to be anterior to the dissolution of the monastery in the
reign of Henry VIII. (P. 23.) The Queen's Oak at Huntingfield, in
Suffolk, was situated in a park belonging to Lord Hunsdon, where he had
the honour of entertaining Queen Elizabeth. The queen is reported to
have shot a buck with her own hand from this oak. (P. 26.) Sir Philip
Sidney's Oak, near Penshurst, is said to have been planted at his birth,
in 1554: it has been celebrated by Ben Jonson and Waller. This oak is
above twenty-two feet in girth; it is hollow, and stag-headed; and, so
far as can be judged from the engraving, has an appearance of great
antiquity, though its age only reaches back to the sixteenth century.
(P. 27.) The Tortworth Chestnut is described as being not only the
largest, but the oldest tree in England: Evelyn alleges that "it
continued a signal boundary to that manor in King Stephen's time, as it
stands<a id="Page_403"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[403]</span> upon record;" but the date of the record is not mentioned.
We can hardly suppose that it was cotemporaneous. (<i>Ib.</i> p. 29.) An elm
at Chequers in Buckinghamshire is reported, by a tradition handed down
in the families of the successive owners, to have been planted in the
reign of Stephen. (<i>Ib.</i> p. 38.) Respecting the Wallace Oak, at
Ellerslie near Paisley, it is reported that Sir William Wallace, and
three hundred of his men, hid themselves among its branches from the
English. This legend is probably fabulous; if it were true, it would
imply that the tree was in its full vigour at the end of the thirteenth
century. (<i>Ib.</i> p. 5.) The ash at Carnock, in Stirlingshire, supposed to
be the largest in Scotland, and still a luxuriant tree, was planted
about the year 1596, by Sir Thomas Nicholson of Carnock, Lord Advocate
of Scotland in the reign of James VI. (<i>Ib.</i> p. 8.)</p>

<p>Marshall, in his Work on <i>Planting and Rural Ornament</i> (2 vols. 1796)
refers to a paper on the age of trees, by Mr. Marsham, in the first
volume of the <i>Transactions of the Bath Agriculture Society</i>, in which
the Tortworth Chestnut is calculated to be not less than 1100 years old.
Marshall, who appears to have examined this tree with great care,
corrects the account given by Mr. Marsham, and states that it is not
one, but two trees. Sir Robert Atkins, in his <i>History of
Gloucestershire</i>, says: "By tradition this tree was growing in King
John's reign." Evelyn, however, as we have already seen, speaks of a
record that it served as a manor boundary in the reign of Stephen.
Query, on what authority do these statements rest? Marshall thinks that
a duration of nearly a thousand years may be fairly assigned to the
Tortworth tree; and he adds:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"If we consider the quick growth of the chestnut, compared with
   that of the oak, and at the same time the inferior bulk of the
   Tortworth Chestnut to the Cowthorp, the Bentley, and the
   Boddington oaks, may we not venture to infer that the existence
   of these truly venerable trees commenced some centuries prior to
   the era of Christianity?"</p>


<p>The oaks here alluded to by Marshall are of immense size. The Cowthorp
Oak is near Wetherby; the Bentley Oak, in Holt Forest, near Bentley; the
Boddington Oak, between Cheltenham and Tewksbury (vol. ii. pp. 127.
298.).</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your correspondents may be able to point out authentic
evidence respecting the true dates of ancient trees. A large tree is a
subject of interest to the entire neighbourhood: it receives an
individual name, like a river, a mountain, or a building; and by its
permanence it affords a fixed point for a faithful local tradition to
rest upon. On the other hand, the infidelity of oral tradition is well
known; and the mere interest which attaches to a tree of unusual size is
likely to give birth to a romantic legend, when its true history has
been forgotten. The antiquary and the botanist may assist one another in
determining the age of trees. By the authentic evidence of their
duration which the former is able to furnish, the latter may establish
tests by which their longevity may be calculated.</p>

<h3>
<span>LINES ATTRIBUTED TO ADMIRAL BYNG.</span>
</h3>

<p>The following lines are copied, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>, from a window
pane in an upstairs room of the Talbot Inn, Ripley. The tradition is
that they were written by Admiral Byng, who was confined in the room as
a prisoner when on his way to Portsmouth; that sentinels were placed on
the staircase outside; that during the night the admiral walked past the
sleeping guard, gathered some flowers from the inn garden, and returned
to his room; and that on leaving the following morning, he told the Inn
Lady he should see her on his way back to London, when he was acquitted.</p>

<h3>
<span>A CHAPTER ON EMBLEMS.</span>
</h3>

<p>"An history of emblems in all languages, with specimens of the poetry
and engravings, accompanied by some account of the authors, would be a
very interesting contribution to our literature." Thus speaks the author
of a work remarkable for interest, information, and elegance of taste,
viz., <i>Lives of Sacred Poets</i>, by Robert Willmott, Esq.; and truly such
a work would be a great <i>desideratum</i> were the idea here suggested
efficiently carried out.</p>

<p>In our own, and in other languages, many beautiful poems&mdash;some of them
very gems&mdash;exist,<a id="Page_404"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[404]</span> attached to, and written on some of "the most
ridiculous prints that ever excited merriment." A tasteful collection of
the more beautiful poems, with some spirited woodcuts, or engravings to
accompany them, would form a beautiful volume. This, however, is a
suggestion different from, and secondary to, Mr. Willmott's.</p>

<p>Emblems, figures, symbols, &amp;c., constitute a vast ocean of associations
which all enter on, all understand, all sympathise with more or less.
They enrich our language, enter into our commonest thoughts and
conversation, as well as our compositions in poetry and prose.</p>

<p>Often the clearest ideas we have on abstruse points are derived from
them, <i>e.g.</i> the <i>shamrock</i> or <i>trefoil</i> is an emblem of <i>the Blessed
Trinity</i>. Nothing perhaps helps us to comprehend the resurrection of the
body, and in a glorified state through preserving its identity, as the
apostle's illustration and emblem of the <i>growth of corn</i>.</p>

<p>In a work on the subject it would be desirable to keep the classical,
artistic, political, and other emblems apart from the sacred and moral,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I must now say a few words on a book of emblems, entitled <i>Schola
Cordis, sive Aversi a Deo Cordis, ad eumdem reductio et instructio,
Authore Benedicto Haefteno, Antv.</i> 1635. (This Benedict Haeften was also
the author of <i>Regia Via Crucis</i>, published at Antwerp the same year as
the above, in 2 vols. 8vo., I think, and afterwards translated into
French.) This work suggested <i>Schola Cordis, or the Heart of itself gone
away from God, brought back again to Him and instructed by Him, in XLVII
emblems</i>: London, printed for M. Blunder at the Castle in Cornhill,
1647, 12mo. pp. 196. The authorship of this English <i>Schola Cordis</i> is
generally attributed to Christopher Harvie, the author of <i>The
Synagogue</i>. (Vide Lowndes, and a note in Pickering's edition of George
Herbert.) The second edition was printed in 1674, third in 1675, fourth
in 1676.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Tegg in 1845 printed an edition of this <i>Schola Cordis</i> as the
production of Francis Quarles; what was his authority I know not, he
certainly did not attempt to give any.</p>

<p>The last three books of Quarles's <i>Emblems</i> contain forty-five prints,
all from Herman Hugo's <i>Pia Desideria</i>, which has that number of
emblems. Quarles sometimes translates, sometimes paraphrases Hugo, and
has a good deal of original matter. His first two books are not in
Hugo's work, and I do not know whence they are derived; nearly all the
cuts contain a globe and cross.</p>

<p>Herman Hugo had the talents and versatility which characterise his order
(the Order of Jesus), "he was a philosopher, a linguist, a theologian, a
poet, and a soldier, and under the command of Spinola is said to have
performed prodigies of valour." He was the author of <i>De prima Scribendi
Origine et Universa Rei Literariæ Antiquitate</i>, an excellent work; and
of <i>De Militia Equestri antiqua et nova</i> amongst others. His <i>Book of
Emblems</i> was first published at Antwerp, 1624. It is divided into
<i>three</i> books, viz.,</p>


<div class="poem">

     <div class="stanza">     <p class="i5"> Pia Desideria.</p></div>

   <div class="stanza">   <p>1. Gemitus   {A   }  P&oelig;nitentis.</p>
      <p>2. Vota&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {ni  }  Sanctæ.</p>
      <p>3. Suspiria  {mæ}  Amantis.</p></div>

</div>


<p class="noindent">Each book contains fifteen emblems. The principal editions are, Antv.
1624, ed. princeps; Antv. 1628, 1632; Græcii, 1651; Lond. 1677,
sumptibus Roberti Pawlet, Chancery Lane. This London edition contains
only verse, whereas all the other editions contain metre and prose
before each picture, the prose being far the better of the two. The only
prose that Pawlet's edition has is a motto from one of the Fathers at
the back of each picture.</p>

<p>There are two or three English translations. I have seen but one, a
miserable translation of the verse part, I suppose from Pawlet's
edition. There are short notices of emblems in the <i>Retrospective
Review</i>, ix. 123-140.; <i>Critical Review</i>, Sept. 1801 (attributed to
Southey); see also Willmott's <i>Lives of Sacred Poets</i> (Wither and
Quarles); Cæsar Ripa's <i>Iconologia</i>, Padua, 1627; and <i>Alciati
Emblemata</i>, Lugd. 1614. The Fagel Library, Trinity College, Dublin, has
a fine copy of the first edition of the <i>Pia Desideria</i>, and upwards of
sixty books of emblems, principally Dutch.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;When I penned the above I was not aware that any mention of the
<i>School of the Heart</i> had been made in
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>." I find in
Southey's fourth <i>Common-place Book</i> that he quotes from the <i>School of
the Heart</i> as Quarles's. He has the following note on Quarles's Emblems:
"Philips erroneously says that the emblems are a copy from Hermannus
Hugo." I know not what Philips exactly intended by the word "copy;" but
if any one doubts what I have before said respecting these Emblems, let
him compare Hugo and Quarles together. I forgot to give the title of the
first edition of Hugo: <i>Pia Desideria Emblematis, Elegiis et Affectibus,
SS. Patrum Illustrata, vulgavit Boetius a Bolswert</i>, Antv. 1624. Also
the title of our English translation: <i>Pia Desideria; or, Divine
Addresses</i>, in three books, written in Latin by Herm. Hugo, Englished by
Edm. Arwaker, M.A., Lond. 1686, 8vo., pp. 282., dedicated to the
Princess Anne of Denmark, with forty-seven plates by Sturt.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cheshire Folk Lore and Superstition.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is in this town a little
girl, about thirteen years old, in great request among the poor as a
charmer in cases of burns or scalds. Immediately on the accident the
girl is fetched from her work in the mill; on her arrival she kneels
down by the side of the sufferer, mutters a few words, and touches the
individual, and the people believe and affirm that the sufferings
immediately cease, as she has charmed the fire out of the parts injured.
The surgeon's aid is then called in to heal the sores. The girl affirms
that she found it out herself by reading her Bible, of which the
wonder-working charm is a verse. She will take no reward, nor may any of
her relatives; if she or they were, her power would be at an end. She is
an ordinary, merry, playful girl; as a surgeon I often come across her
in such accidents.</p>

<p>I know some other such charmers in Cheshire, but none so young. One, an
old man, stops bleedings of all kinds by a similar charm, viz. a verse
from the Bible. But he does not require to be at the patient's side, his
power being equally efficacious at the distance of one hundred miles, as
close by.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sterling, in a letter to Carlyle, objects to the use of

<h4>
<span><i>Anagram.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Sir J. Stephen, in his essay on <i>The French Benedictines</i>,

bibliophagist Magliabechi:&mdash;Antonius Magliabechius&mdash;Is unus bibliotheca
magna.</p>

<p>In the same essay he says that Mabillon called Magliabechi "Museum
inambulans, et viva quædam bibliotheca." Possibly this is the origin of
our expression "a walking dictionary."</p>

when, or by whom, they were so given, I have not been able to learn. A
friend of mine who was lately examining them was told that they were
formerly called "Nails," and gave rise to the saying, "Pay down upon the

is, in the space of privilege, or took their chance with the many? Had
they, under his own eye, been grouped together, what a treat it must

speaks of a curious ceremony, as practised there every Palm Sunday,
respecting a peculiar tenure. I do not find it referred to in any other
account of Castor Church. Bourne, in his <i>Antiquities</i>, vol. i. p. 130.,
gives the history of it, but says it is practised at Caistor Church in
Lincolnshire. Is the doctor right in his statement? I would also be glad

<span>298. <i>Panelling Inscription.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have recently discovered, in my
investigations for the <i>History and Antiquities of South Lynn</i>, an old
building in this town which bears the date 1605 on one of its gables;
and in the course of my peregrinations through, I find some old
panelling with the date 1676, and the following inscription in old
English (large) characters:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "As nothinge is so absolutly blest</p>
        <p class="i3">But chance may crosse, and make it seeming ill,</p>

      <p class="i3"> But God may chang, and seeing good he will."</p>

</div>

<p>It has been suggested to me that these lines form a quotation from some
of our English poets; if so, of whom? for it is of great importance to
me to know, as it will tend considerably to connect the date with the
building; and if the lines can be traced to a writer of the period, it
will establish what I require very much, and assist me in my researches.</p>

rounds beings fired, and only one man killed! and another instance of
80,000, and twenty-five killed! Any remarkable instances of the
inefficiency of musketry fire will be acceptable.</p>

<span>THE REVEREND RICHARD FARMER.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 379.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Assuming that the principal A<span class="smcap lowercase">TROCITIES</span> of the reverend Richard Farmer
are his <i>Essay on the learning of Shakespeare</i>, and the substance of a
note on <i>Hamlet</i>, Act V. Sc. 2., I shall transcribe, as a hint to the
lovers of manly criticism, a general character of that writer, a
character of his <i>Essay</i>, and the note in question:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">1. "His knowledge is various, extensive, and recondite. With much
   seeming negligence, and perhaps in later years some real
   relaxation, he understands more and remembers more about common
   and uncommon subjects of literature, than many of those who would
   be thought to read all the day and meditate half the night. In
   quickness of apprehension and acuteness of discrimination I have
   not often seen his equal."&mdash;Samuel P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARR.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">2. "It [the <i>Essay on the learning of Shakespeare</i>] may in truth
   be pointed out as a master-piece, whether considered with a view
   to the sprightliness and vivacity with which it is written, the
   clearness of the arrangement, the force and variety of the
   evidence, or the compression of scattered materials into a narrow
   compass; materials which inferior writers would have expanded
   into a large volume."&mdash;Isaac R<span class="smcap lowercase">EED.</span></p>

<p class="blockquot"> 3. "There's a divinity that <i>shapes our ends</i>, <i>Rough-hew</i> [them
   how we will.] Dr. Farmer informs me, that these words are merely
   technical. A wool-man, butcher, and dealer in <i>skewers</i>, lately
   observed to him, that his nephew (an idle lad), could only
   <i>assist</i> him in making them;"&mdash;'he could <i>rough-hew</i> them, but I
   was obliged to <i>shape their ends</i>.' [To shape the ends of
   <i>wool-skewers</i>, i.e. to <i>point</i> them, requires a degree of skill;
   any one can <i>rough-hew</i> them.] Whoever recollects the profession
   of Shakespeare's father, will admit that his son might be no
   stranger to such a term [such terms]. I have [frequently] seen
   packages of wool pinn'd up with <i>skewers</i>.&mdash;S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEEVENS.</span></p>

<p>This note was first printed by Malone in 1780,<a id="Page_408"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[408]</span> and was reprinted
by him in 1790; the portions within brackets having been added in 1793?
It is clear, from this statement, that it received the deliberate
revision of its author. Now, I cannot deny that Farmer related the
anecdote of the <i>wool-man</i>&mdash;suspicious as is the character of the
witness, but I contend that the observations on it should be ascribed to
Steevens alone; and so I shall leave your critic A. E. B. to his own
reflections.</p>

<span>ANGLO-CATHOLIC LIBRARY.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 365.)</span>
</h3>

<p>A S<span class="smcap lowercase">UBSCRIBER TO THE</span> A<span class="smcap lowercase">NGLO</span>-C<span class="smcap lowercase">ATHOLIC</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">IBRARY</span> has discovered <i>one</i> fault in
<i>one</i> volume (published in 1844) of a series which now extends to
sixty-three volumes; and on this <i>one fault</i> he builds a representation
which implies, in general, incompetency in the editors, and neglect of
proper supervision on the part of the committee of the Anglo-Catholic
Library. I believe the character of the editions of most of the volumes
sent out in this series is sufficiently known to theologians to render
such a charge as this of little importance as respects their judgment.
But it may not be so with many of the readers of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>."</p>

<p>The gravamen of the charge rests on the importance of a certain passage
of St. Jerome bearing on the Presbyterian controversy,&mdash;on the necessity
for a familiarity with that controversy in an editor of Overall's
<i>Convocation Book</i>,&mdash;and the consequent incompetency of a person not
thus familiar with it to edit that work without, not the assistance
merely, but the immediate supervision of the committee.</p>

<p>Now the subject of episcopacy is <i>not</i>, as the Subscriber alleges, "the
principal subject" of this Book; it occupies 30 pages out of 272: nor is
a familiarity with that controversy in any special way necessary for an
editor of the volume. The subjects of which the <i>Convocation Book</i>
treats are wide and varied, and such omnigenous knowledge as a familiar
acquaintance with them implies, is not, nor could be, required in any
editor, nor be expected by subscribers.</p>

<p>The committee of the Anglo-Catholic Library undertook to publish careful
reprints of the works of our old divines; and had they simply reprinted
with accuracy the <i>Convocation Book</i>, as published in 1690, they would
have fulfilled their covenant with the subscribers. They did, however,
much more.</p>

<p>It was known that the original MS. copy of this Book was preserved at
Durham. The edition of 1690 had been printed from a transcript made by
Archbishop Sancroft. The committee therefore engaged the services of a
gentleman whose name is well known as an accurate editor of works
existing in MS.</p>

<p>This gentlemen obtained access to all the known MSS. of the <i>Convocation
Book</i>; viz. 1. The original copy, and papers of alterations suggested as
it passed through the Upper House, preserved at Durham. 2. A cotemporary
MS. of part of the first book, also preserved at Durham. 3. Archbishop
Sancroft's Transcript, preserved at Emanuel College, Cambridge and 4. A
MS. of the first book belonging to Bishop Barlow, preserved at Queen's
College, Oxford. These MSS. were carefully collated, and the variations,
in many respects curious and interesting, were printed at the bottom of
the pages, and, as regards the 4th MS., at the end of the volume. The
result is a correct edition of the text of this book, with all that can
be learned of its variations&mdash;the book so highly extolled by your
correspondent. And I hear no objection alleged against the care and
faithfulness with which this part of the work has been executed: your
correspondent does not appear to be aware of anything of the kind having
been done.</p>

<p>But the editor went still further&mdash;he not only gave the subscribers so
much more than they had bargained for, he added full references to the
authorities quoted in the book; and when the passages were important, he
printed them in full, and even added references to works in which the
arguments were more largely handled. Now these references appear to me
to amount to many hundreds. They begin with Josephus, and run through
Fathers, councils, schoolmen, Roman Catholic controversialists,
ecclesiastical historians, and the chroniclers of the Middle Ages: and,
as far as I can judge in looking over the notes, not more than three or
four of these passages have been undiscovered by the editor, and he
honestly says he has not found them; one of these is the unlucky place
of St. Jerome, which your correspondent happens to know something about.</p>

<p>The remarks of your correspondent have led me to examine the book, and I
refer any one who has the least regard for candour or fairness, to do
the same. I would ask them to judge it as a whole, to see the number and
variety of the references, and the care which has been bestowed upon
them; and to say whether&mdash;because he missed one passage, and knew not
its importance&mdash;the editor can be fairly charged with incompetency; or
the committee of the Anglo-Catholic Library accused of neglect, in
leaving the work in his hands without exercising over him such
supervision as implies the reading every sheet as it passed through the
press; for <i>assistance</i> the editor had, and amply acknowledges that he
received, at the hand of the superintending editor.</p>

<h3>
<span>GENERAL JAMES WOLFE.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 271. 322.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Many letters of Wolfe's will be found published in the <i>Naval and
Military Gazette</i> of the latter part of last and early part of this
year.</p>

<p>By the statement of your correspondent
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLE</span>, Wolfe was promoted as
captain in Burrell's regiment (at present the 4th, or king's own) in
1744. Now Burrell's regiment took the left of the first line at
Culloden, so that James Wolfe, unless absent on leave, or employed on
particular duty, must have been in that action. The left of the second
line was occupied by "Colonel Wolfe's" regiment (now the 8th or
"king's"). See the "Rebellion of 1745," by Robert Chambers, in
Constable's <i>Miscellany</i>, vol. xvi. p. 86. Captains of <i>nineteen</i> were
common enough at that period, but Wolfe is the only one whose name has
excited attention.</p>

<p>As to Wolfe's having been "the youngest general ever intrusted with such
a responsible command" as that at Quebec, your correspondent surely
forgets Napoleon in modern, and the Black Prince in more remote times.</p>

<p>I have seen at Mr. Scott's, of Cahircon, in the co. Clare, an engraving
of Wolfe: he is designated as the "Hero of Louisburgh," and is
represented with his right to the spectator, the right hand and arm
raised as if enforcing an order. The features are small, the nose rather
"cocked," and the face conveys the idea of spirit and determination; he
wears a very small three-cocked hat, with a plain black cockade, a sort
of frock coat reaching to the knees, where it is met by long boots;
there are no epaulets, a twist belt confines the coat, and supports a
cartouche-box in front, and a bayonet at the right side, and he carries
a fusil slung from his right shoulder "en bandouillière."</p>

<p>It is said that the father of Wolfe was an Irishman, and I have been
shown in the co. Wicklow the farm on which it is said that James Wolfe
was born. It lies near Newtown-Mount-Kennedy. Be that as it may, the
name has been made celebrated in Ireland within the last half century by
three individuals: first, the Lord Kilwarden, who was murdered during
Emmett's rising in 1803; secondly, the late Chief Baron, who spelt his
name "with a difference;" and last, not least, the author of the
celebrated lines on the "Burial of Sir John Moore."</p>

<h3>
<span>PUNISHMENT OF EDWARD OF CAERNARVON BY HIS FATHER.&mdash;CHARACTER OF EDWARD
I.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 338.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I think considerable light is thrown upon this very remarkable incident
by a letter of the prince himself to the Earl of Lincoln, dated
Midhurst, June 14, which appears upon the Roll of that prince's letters
lately discovered at the Chapter House, Westminster. (See <i>Ninth Report
of the Deputy Keeper of the Public Records</i>, App. II., No. 5.) This
letter has been printed in one of the volumes of the Sussex
Archæological Society, having been written from that county. For such of
your readers as may not have either of these books at command, I will
give the material part of the letter, translated:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"On Sunday, the 13th of June, we came to Midhurst, where we found
   the lord the king, our father; the Monday following, on account
   of certain words which, it had been reported to the king, had
   taken place <i>between us and the Bishop of Chester</i>, he was so
   enraged with us that he has forbidden us, or any of our retinue,
   to dare to enter his house; and he has forbidden all the people
   of his household and of the exchequer to give or lend us anything
   for the support of our household. We are staying at Midhurst to
   wait his pleasure and favour, and we shall follow after him as
   well as we are able, at a distance of ten or twelve miles from
   his house, until we have been able to recover his good will,
   which we very much desire."</p>

<p>The roll contains several letters which show how seriously the prince
was affected by his father's displeasure, and how the king was appeased.</p>

<p>By the letter above quoted, the "minister" appears to have been the
Bishop of Chester, then treasurer of the royal household. But the
connexion between the prince's case and that of William de Brewosa does
not appear, unless they were on intimate terms, as is not improbable:
and the punishment of the prince himself is, in my opinion, referred to
as a precedent or justification of the punishment imposed upon Brewes.
That the severe punishment so imposed was richly deserved none can doubt
who has read the report on the Roll: but an unfortunate error in the
press<a id="press2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> makes it appear that the prince, and not De Brewes, was the
culprit, and performed the penance.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#press2" class="label">[2]</a> Page
 339. col. 1. line 46., where "Edward" is printed
instead of "William de Brewes."</p>

<p>To return to the prince's offence and punishment. He appears to have
been nearly starved into submission, as the royal prohibition against
supplying him with articles or money was obliged to be removed by a
Letter Close directed to all the sheriffs, dated Ospring, 22nd July.</p>

<p>The whole transaction is highly characteristic of the firmness of the
king. Whether the prince's letters which I have referred to make out a
case of <i>harshness</i>, as regards some other circumstances, I will not now
trouble you with. But while examining cotemporary documents illustrative
of the prince and his correspondents, I met with an entry upon the Close
Roll (33 Edw. I.) too strikingly illustrative of the determination
and<a id="Page_410"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[410]</span> caution of Edward I. to be allowed to remain in its present
obscurity.</p>

<p>On the 27th November the prince addressed a letter to Master Gerard de
Pecoraria, earnestly begging him to favour and forward the affairs of
Ralph de Baldok, then Bishop Elect of London. The "affairs" in question
were the removal of certain scruples instilled into the Papal ear
against the approval of the bishop elect; a matter generally involving
some diplomacy and much money. Master Gerard was employed by the Pope to
collect various dues in England; and so his good will was worth
obtaining. But the following Letter Close will show how he received his
"quietus," as far as the King of England was concerned:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The King to Ralph de Sandwich.&mdash;By reason of the excessive and
   indecent presumption with which Gerard de Pecoraria is making
   oppressive levies and collections of money in various places; by
   whose authority we know not, for he will not show it; and
   inasmuch as the same is highly derogatory to our crown, and
   injurious to our people, and many complaints have been made
   against him on that account; We command you to take the said
   Gerard before the Mayor and Sheriffs of London, and there warn
   him to cease from making the said levies, and to quit the kingdom
   in six days, <i>provided that at such warning no public notary be
   present, so that the warning be given to the said Gerard alone,
   no one else hearing. And be you careful that no one but yourself
   see this letter, or get a copy thereof.</i>"</p>

<p>Who can doubt that such a mandate was strictly carried out?</p>

Edward was an insult to Walter de Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and
Coventry, occasioned probably by the boldness with which that prelate,
while treasurer, corrected the insolence of Peter de Gaveston, and
restrained the Prince's extravagance. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 114.)</p>

<span>ELIZABETH JOCELINE'S LEGACY TO AN UNBORNE CHILD.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 367.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondent J. M. G., whose letter is inserted in your 106th
Number, labours under various mistakes relating to this small volume.
The first edition was not printed in 1684, but more than sixty years
earlier. Moreover, that edition, or at least what the Rev. C. H.
Craufurd appended to his Sermons in 1840 as a reprint, is not a genuine
or faithful republication of the original work. I have for several years
possessed a copy of <i>the third impression</i>, Printed at "London, by <i>Iohn
Hauiland</i>, for <i>Hanna Barres</i>, 1625;" and of this third impression a
<i>fac-simile</i> reprint has passed through the press of Messrs. Blackwood
in Edinburgh, which new edition corresponds <i>literatim et verbatim</i>
(line for line and page for page) with the earliest impression known to
exist, which differs materially in several passages from the reprint
published by Mr. Craufurd. This new edition is accompanied by a long
preface or dissertation containing many particulars relating to the
authoress and her relatives, and to a number of ladies of high station
and polished education, who during the period intervening between the
Reformation in England and the Revolution in 1688, distinguished
themselves by publishing works characterized by exalted piety and
refined taste. With regard to Mrs. Joceline, no printed work appears to
have preserved correct information. Genealogists seem to have conspired
to change her Christian name from Elizabeth to Mary or Jane. The husband
is supposed to have sprung from an old Cambridgeshire family, the
Joscelyns of Hogington, now called Oakington, the name of a parish
adjoining to Cottenham. The writer of the preface seems rather disposed
to trace his parentage to John Joscelyn (Archbishop Parker's chaplain),
who, according to Strype, was <i>an Essex man</i>.</p>

<span><i>Coleridge's "Christabel"</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 316.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I am not familiar with
the Coleridge Papers, under that title, nor indeed am I quite sure that
I know at all to what papers M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ORTIMER</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OLLINS</span> refers in his
question. On this account I am not qualified, as he will perhaps think,
to give an opinion upon the genuineness of the lines quoted as a
continuation of "Christabel." If I may be allowed, however, to hazard a
judgment, as one to whom most of the great poet-philosopher's works have
long and affectionately been known, I would venture to express an
opinion against the right of these lines to admission as one of his
productions. I do it with diffidence; but with the hope that I may aid
in eliciting the truth concerning them.</p>

<p>I presume "brookless plash" is a misprint for "brooklet's plash."</p>

<p>The expressions "the sorrow of human years," "wild despair," "the years
of life below," of a person who is not yet dead and in heaven, do not
seem to me, <i>as they stand in the lines</i>, to be in<a id="Page_411"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[411]</span> Coleridge's
manner; but especially I do not think the couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Who felt all grief, all wild despair,</p>
      <p>That the race of man may ever bear,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">is one which Coleridge would have penned, reading as I do in the <i>Aids
to Reflection</i>, vol. i. p. 255. (edit. Pickering, 1843) his protest
against the doctrine</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"holden by more than one of these divines, that the agonies
   suffered by Christ were equal in amount to the sum total of the
   torments of all mankind here and hereafter, or to the infinite
   debt which in an endless succession of instalments we should have
   been paying to the divine justice, had it not been paid in full
   by the Son of God incarnate!"</p>

<p>There are one or two other expressions of which I entertain doubt, but
not in sufficient degree to make it worth while to dwell upon them.</p>

<p>Are we ever likely to receive from any member of Coleridge's family, or
from his friend Mr. J. H. Green, the fragments, if not the entire work,
of his <i>Logosophia</i>? We can ill afford to lose a work the conception of
which engrossed much of his thoughts, if I am rightly informed, towards
the close of his life.</p>

correspondent L. B. L. (Vol. i., p. 371.). I am now satisfied that it is
an altered form of the word <i>lahcop</i>, which occurs in the laws of
Ethelred, and is explained in Thorpe's <i>Ancient Laws and Institutes of
England</i>, vol. i., p. 294., note. The word <i>loveday</i>, which is found in
English Middle-Age writers, meaning "a day appointed for settling
differences by arbitration," is an instance of a similar change. This
must originally have been <i>lah-dæg</i>, though I am not aware that the word
is met with in any Anglo-Saxon documents. But in Old-Norse is found
<i>Lögdagr</i>, altered in modern Danish into <i>Lavdag</i> or <i>Lovdag.</i></p>

of books presented by the poet Drummond to the University of Edinburgh.
A careful reprint, limited to forty copies, was published at Edinburgh
in 1840. It is said to have been done under the superintendance of James
Maidment, Esq.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Lord Edward Fitzgerald</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 173.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent R. H.
was misinformed as to the house of Lord Edward Fitzgerald at Harold's
Cross, from the fact of his friend confounding that nobleman with
another of the United Irishmen leaders; namely, Robert Emmett, who was
arrested in the house alluded to. Lord Edward never lived at Harold's
Cross, either in avowed residence or concealment.</p>

<p>R. H.'s note above referred to, provoked the communication of L. M. M.
at Vol. iv., p. 230., who seems to cast a slur upon the Leinster family
for neglecting the decent burial of their chivalric relative. This is
not merited. The family was kept in complete ignorance as to how the
body was disposed of, it being the wish of the government of the day to
conceal the place of its sepulture; as is evident from their not
interring it at St. Michan's, where they interred Oliver Bond and all
the others whom they put to death at Newgate; and from the notoriety of
their having five years later adopted a similar course with regard to
the remains of Robert Emmett. (See Madden's <i>Life of Emmett</i>.) But is he
buried at St. Werburgh's? Several, and among others his daughter, Lady
Campbell, as appears from L. M. M.'s note, think that he is. I doubt it.
Some years since I conversed with an old man named Hammet, the
superannuated gravedigger of St. Catherine's, Dublin, and he told me
that he officiated at Lord Edward's obsequies in St. Catherine's church,
and that they were performed at night in silence, secrecy, and mystery.</p>

<span><i>Earwig</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 274.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I do not know what the derivations of
this word may be, which are referred to by <span title="[Greek: AXÔN]">&#913;&#926;&#937;&#925;</span> as being in
vogue. It is a curious fact that Johnson, Richardson, and Webster do not
notice the word at all; although I am not aware that it is of limited or
provincial use. In Bailey's <i>Scottish Dictionary</i>, and in Skinner's
<i>Etymologicon</i>, it is traced to the Anglo-Saxon <i>ear-wicga</i>, i.e.
ear-beetle. In Bosworth's <i>Dictionary</i> we find <i>wicga</i>, a kind of
insect, a shorn-bug, a beetle.</p>

<span><i>Sanderson and Taylor</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 293.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In No. 103 of
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," under the head of "<i>Sanderson and Taylor</i>," a question is put
by W. W. as to the common source of the sentence, "Conscience is the
brightness and splendour of the eternal light, a spotless mirror of the
Divine majesty, and the image of the goodness of God." Without at all
saying that it is the common source, I would beg to refer W. W. to "The
Wisdom of Solomon," c. vii. v. 26., where "wisdom"<a id="Page_412"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[412]</span>  is described
as "the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the
power of God, and the image of His goodness." The coincidence is
curious, though the Latin expressions are dissimilar, the verse in "The
Wisdom of Solomon" being as follows: "Nam splendor est à luce æterna et
speculum efficacitatis Dei expers maculæ, ac imago bonitatis ejus."</p>

<p>&mdash;In Lemprière's <i>Classical Dict.</i>, by the Rev. J. A. Giles, 1843,
is the subjoined:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The most remarkable remnant of antiquity at the present day is
   the temple of 'Jupiter Panhellinius' on a <i>mount of the same

   specimen of Doric architecture; Dodwell pronounces it to be the

<span><i>The Broad Arrow</i> </span>

    <p class="i5">  "&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; a Broad-Arrow,</p>

<p>I would however suggest, that the use of an arrow-head as a government
mark may have a Celtic origin; and that the so-called arrow may be the
<span title="[Arrow symbol]">&#8593;</span> or <i>â</i>, the broad <i>a</i> of the Druids. This letter was
typical of superiority either in rank and authority, intellect or
holiness; and I believe stood also for king or prince.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Consecration of Bishops in Sweden</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 345.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;E. H. A. asks
whether any record exists of the consecration of Bethvid, Bishop of
<i>Strengnäs</i> in the time of Gustavus I., King of Sweden? I cannot reply
from this place with the certainty I might be able to do, if I had
access to my books and papers. But I may venture to state, that the
"consecration" (if by that term be meant the canonical and apostolical
ordination) of Bethvidus Sermonis, in common with that of all the
Lutheran Bishops of Sweden, is involved in much doubt and obscurity; the
fact being, that they all derive their orders from <i>Petrus Magni</i>,
Bishop of Westeras, who <i>is said</i> to have been "consecrated" bishop of
that see at Rome by a cardinal in <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1524, the then Pontiff having
acceded to the request of Gustavus Vasa to this effect. It is, however,
uncertain whether Petrus Magni ever received proper episcopal
consecration, although it appears probable he did. I endeavoured at one
time to ascertain the fact by reference to Rome; but though promised by
my correspondent (a British Romanist resident there) that he would
procure the examination of the Roll of Bishops in communion with the
Holy See, and consecrated by Papal license, for the purpose of
discovering whether Bishop Petrus Magni's name occurred therein or not,
I never heard more of the subject. I could not help judging, that this
silence on the part of my correspondent (to whom I was personally
unknown), after his having replied immediately and most civilly to my
first communication, was very eloquent and significant. But still the
doubt remains uncleared, as to whether the Swedish episcopacy possess or
not, <i>as they maintain they do</i>, the blessing of an apostolical and
canonical succession.</p>

<span><i>Meaning of Spon</i> </span>

<p>&mdash;Is the word <i>spooney</i> derived
from the Anglo-Saxon <i>spanan</i>, <i>spón</i>, <i>asponen</i>, to allure, entice, and
therefore equivalent to one allured, trapped, &amp;c., a gowk or simpleton?
If C. H. B. could discover whether those specified places were ever at
any time tenanted by objectionable characters, this verb and its
derivatives might assist his inquiries. He will, however, see that
<i>Spondon</i> (pronounced <i>spoondon</i>) in Derbyshire is another instance of
the word he inquires after.</p>

a committee of Friends were intending to publish, ever took place, that
no committee was ever appointed by the Society of Friends, who adopt the

and other authorised publications. I have inquired of many Friends who
were likely to know, and not one ever heard of what the authoress of

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p>We had occasion, some short time since, to speak in terms of deserved
commendation of the excellent <i>Handbook to the Antiquities of the
British Museum</i> which had been prepared by Mr. Vaux. Another and most
important department of our great national collection has just found in
Dr. Mantell an able scientific, yet popular expositor of its treasures.
His <i>Petrifactions and their Teachings, or a Handbook to the Gallery of
Organic Remains in the British Museum</i>, forms the new volume of Bohn's
<i>Scientific Library</i>; and, thanks to the acquirements of Dr. Mantell,
his good sense in divesting his descriptions, as much as possible, of
technical language, and the numerous well-executed woodcuts by which it
is illustrated, the work is admirably calculated to accomplish the
purpose for which it has been prepared; namely, to serve as a handbook
to the general visitor to the Gallery of Organic Remains, and as an
explanatory Catalogue for the more scientific observer.</p>

<p>To satisfy the deep interest taken by many persons, who are unable to
study the phenomena themselves, in the numerous new and remarkable facts
relating to the formation and temperature of the globe, and to the
movements of the ocean and of the atmosphere, as well as to the
influence of both on climate, and on the adaptation of the earth for the
dwelling of man, which the exertions of scientific men have of late
years revealed, was the motive which led Professor Buff to write his
<i>Familiar Letters on the Physics of the Earth; treating of the chief
Movements of the Land, the Waters, and the Air, and the Forces that give
rise to them</i>: and Dr. Hoffman has been induced to undertake an English
edition of them from a desire of rendering accessible to the public a
source of information from which he has derived no less of profit than
of pleasure: which profit and which pleasure will, we have no doubt, be
shared by a large number of readers of this unpretending but very
instructive little volume.</p>

<p><i>Welsh Sketches, chiefly Ecclesiastical, to the close of the Twelfth
Century.</i> These sketches, which treat of Bardism, the Kings of Wales,
the Welsh Church, Monastic Institutions, and Giraldus Cambrensis, are
from the pen of the amiable author of the <i>Essays on Church Union</i>, and
are written in the same attractive and popular style.</p>

<p>About five-and-thirty years ago the Treatment of the Insane formed the
subject of a Parliamentary inquiry, and the public mind was shocked by
the appalling scenes revealed before a Committee of the House of
Commons. But the publication of them did its work; for that such scenes
are now but matters of history, we owe to that inquiry. The condition of
the London Poor, in like manner, is now in the course of investigation;
not indeed by an official commission, but by a private individual, Mr.
Henry Mayhew, who is gathering by personal visits to the lowest haunts
of poverty and its attendant vices, and from personal communication with
the people he is describing, an amount of fact illustrative of the
social conditions of the poorest classes in this metropolis, which
deserves, and must receive, the earnest attention of the statesman, the
moralist, and the philanthropist. His work is entitled <i>London Labour
and the London Poor, a Cyclopædia of the Condition and Earnings of those
that</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">WILL</span>
 <i>work, those that</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CANNOT</span> <i>work,
and those that</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">WILL NOT</span>
<i>work</i>. Vol. I. <i>The London Street Folk</i>, is just completed. It is of
most painful interest, for it paints in vivid colours the misery,
ignorance, and demoralisation in which thousands are living at our very
doors; and its perusal must awaken in every right-minded man an earnest
desire to do his part towards assisting the endeavours of the honest
poor to earn their bread&mdash;towards instructing the ignorant, and towards
reforming the vicious.</p>

for his kind suggestion, but his proposal a little shocks our modesty.
The subject, he will remember, has been taken up by several of our most
influential contemporaries. It would scarcely become us to suggest that
they should now abandon it to us. We are anxious to help it forward, but
it would be better that we should do so in conjunction with all others
who are willing to labor in the same cause.</i></p>

<p class="center"> OF THE</p>

<p class="center">GREAT EXHIBITION OF THE WORKS OF INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS,</p>

<p class="center x-large"> 1851.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"A complete literary type of the original to which it refers, opening up
sources of amusement or instruction to every class of taste, and proving
equally at home on the drawing-room table, handled by fashionable
dilettanti in a study, pored over by the scholar or the man of science,
at the merchant's desk as a book of constant reference&mdash;in the factory,
the foundry, and the workshop, as a <i>repertoire</i> for designs, and as
highly suggestive for future progress. A more pleasant work to dive into
during an idle hour can hardly be imagined, for wherever it is taken up
there is something new and striking, and worthy of attention."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">"The work is without a precedent in the annals of literature; and when
we regard the circumstances of difficulty that surrounded the task of
its execution, the praise bestowed on those who undertook it can
scarcely be too great. The Contractors, in that enlarged spirit which
appears to have entered into all that belongs to the Exhibition, engaged
men of reputation and authority in every department of science and
manufacture to contribute such descriptive notes as should render the
work currently instructive. It thus contains a body of annotations,
which express the condition of human knowledge and the state of the
world's industry in 1851: and is a document of the utmost importance, as
a summary report of this vast international 'stock-taking,' which no
great library&mdash;nor any gentleman's library, of those who aim at the
collection of literary standards&mdash;can hereafter be without. It is not
the work of a day, a month, or a year: it is for all time. Centuries
hence it will be referred to as an authority on the condition to which
man has arrived at the period of its publication. It is at once a great
Trades Directory, informing us where we are to seek for any particular
kind of manufacture&mdash;a Natural History, recording the localities of
almost every variety of native production&mdash;and a Cyclopædia, describing
how far science has ministered to the necessities of humanity, by what
efforts the crude products of the earth have been converted into
articles of utility or made the medium of that refined expression which
belongs to the province of creative art. The Exhibition has lived its
allotted time, and died; but this Catalogue is the sum of the thoughts
and truths to which it has given birth,&mdash;and which form the intellectual
ground whereon the generations that we are not to see must build.... It
will be evident from what has been already stated that a more important
contribution to a commercial country than the 'Official Descriptive and
Illustrated Catalogue of the Great Exhibition' could scarcely have been

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
